 # Query Language


 - Supported operators are NOT, AND, OR(default if none provided). The operators are case-insensitive, that means however that if you want to search for that specific term it is not possible to just write it in lowercase letters. If you wish to search for it, it is possible by putting it in quotes like this: "NOT", "not", etc...
