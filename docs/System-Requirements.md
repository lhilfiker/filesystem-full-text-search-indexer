# System Requirements

The system needs to run on little endian right now due the way the index data is saved in memory and on disk.
CPU: At least 1 core 64-bit. 32-bit may or may not work.
Memory: Depends on configuration and size of Index and to be indexed files. If you compile it to your max needed usage you can further minimize Memory usage. More configuration options are planned.
